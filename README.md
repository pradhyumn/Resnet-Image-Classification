CS-GY 6953: Deep Learning, Spring 2023, Mini Project (ResNet):

This report presents the development and evaluation of a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture, designed to achieve the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset while adhering to a constraint of no more than 5 million parameters. The mini-project explores various strategies to optimize the network performance and efficiency, effectively balancing model complexity and computational resources. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in meeting the parameter constraints and attaining superior classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
